This `.devcontainer` is set up for basic `ROS2` development without GUI elements. It is enough for most of the development at https://ros2-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and open the folder using VS Code.
2. Choose `Reopen in container` or in the command pallette choose `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

This will enable development in `ROS2` directly in VS Code. To obtain the new developed code back into the host computer, you can run the command pallette `Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally`.
